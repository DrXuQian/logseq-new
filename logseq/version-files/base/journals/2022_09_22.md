- #broadcast #task_gen #nbperf
	- concat/slice/reshape/transpose task 如何构建?
		- 什么时候broadcast是可以穿透这些operator的
	- TaskGen
		- When split strategy changes
			- Always need to update Task when split strategy changes
		- Currently the reason we make the broadcast super complex. This is because the task gen for couple of operators not correct
			- These operators all need input and output task and split method for task gen
			- concat
			- slice
			- reshape
			- transpose
		- Broadcast can be generated after tasks are fixed
		- Temporal Tiling
			- concat + tiled_ops + slice
			- have specific handling for these ops
