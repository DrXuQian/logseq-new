	- **Numpy broadcast**:
		- Right aligned dimensions of the two tensors are compared elementwise.
		- Smaller tensor is prepended with dimension(s) of size 1 in order to have the same shape as the larger tensor.
		- After alignment two tensors are compatible when both are equal or one of the dimensions is 1.
		- Tensor with dimension of size 1 will be implicitly broadcasted to match the size of the second tensor.
		- When both inputs are of rank = 0 the result is a scalar.
