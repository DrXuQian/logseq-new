- What is initializer list in C++? #card
	- ```c++
	  class MyClass {
	  public:
	      int x, y;
	      MyClass(int valueX, int valueY) : x(valueX), y(valueY) {
	          // constructor code
	      }
	  };
	  ```
- How should we initialize a const or reference data member of a class? #card
	- Furthermore, if a class doesn't have a default constructor, or you have a `const` or reference data member, you *must* use an initializer list.
	- Reason:
		- If non-static const data members in your class have default constructors & you don't use constructor initializer list, you won't be able to initialize them to intended state as they will be initialized to their default state.
	- ```c++
	  class A
	  {
	  public:
	      A(int x_) { x = x_; }
	      int x;
	  };
	  
	  class B
	  {
	  public:
	      // 'a' and 'y' MUST be initialized in an initializer list;
	      // it is an error not to do so.
	      B() : a(3), y(2) {}
	  private:
	      A a;
	      const int y;
	  };
	  ```
