- [[weight and activation swizzling]]
- [[split strategy of VPUxCompiler]]
	- Vpuxcompiler have this HKSwitch mode where the input is SOH and the output is SOK. The input is split in spatial dimension, while the output is broadcast to other tiles.
	- This mode, the output won't need to go from CMX->DDR->CMX. But I think sometimes the compiler might chose SOH->SOK over HKSwitch since the memory consumption on CMX is higher for HKSwitch:
		- SOH 1/2 input + 1/2 output + weights
		- SOK input + 1/2 weights + output
		- hkswitch 1/2 input + weights + output
	- Suppose the 1/2 input + weights + output can't fit in CMX for HKSwitch, compiler might choose other strategy.

	- Results
		- •	Feedback and Appreciation
			- o What progress have you made toward your quarterly results including OKRs?
				- Keep developing Nbperf to support VPU-EM. Currently the Nbperf and VPU-EM is ready for initial release.
				- Write SAS documents about weight and activation sparsity.
				- Literature review and performance projection of SOTA Transformer based model like DSTT, TimesFormer and so on.
				- Perform experiments on Nbperf for VPU5TR on topics like Reducing Accumulator Contexts and 2K to 4K MAC scaling and so on.
				- Working on Network Architecture Search for Midas network for efficient inference on VPU hardware.
			- o	What are you most proud of? Why? What is the impact?
				- Developed Nbperf for front end of VPU-EM. We can use math or VPUNN or VPU-EM as cost model. This provides a great choice besides ArchBench and spreadsheet.
			- o	How would you describe your performance this quarter?
				- Solid performance
			- o	What feedback and support do you need from me?
				- ...
		- •	Coaching and Goal Alignment
			- o	What are your top priorities near term? Looking ahead, what are your OKR priorities?
				- Compiler algorithm SAS
				- Nbperf support for VPU-EM
					- Feasible memory allocation algorithm
