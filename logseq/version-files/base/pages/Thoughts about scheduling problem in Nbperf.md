- The key problem is actually memory allocation
- For DMA prefetching:
	- * We have copy operators inserted in the graph
	- We have a scheduling order (some kind of DFS order)
	- Calculate the peak memory for each operator (considering the residual connections that keep the buffer in memory)
		- If exceed CMX memory, insert cmx2ddr for the buffer that is used in latter stages.
		- Else try prefetch the next DMA.
- Make things really really easy.
