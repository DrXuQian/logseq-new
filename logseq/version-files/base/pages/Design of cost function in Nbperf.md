- For a given node `A`, `56x56x256->28x28x512`, wgt `512x256x3x3`:
	- split over `h` and `w`, `2x2x256`, output would also split, `1x1x512`
	- Maximum split on the `h` dims is 28
	- min split is
		- `2*(56x56x256 + 28x28x512) / (cmx-512x256x3x3)`
		- which means the `min_split` to fit `wgt+2tiled_in+2tiled_out` in CMX
		- 2 means count in prefetching the next tile input
	- So in general, the best case of split over H or split over W is:
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1679211061688_0.png)
- For a given node A,
	- split over `k`, maximum split is `32`
	- We should always concat the tiled output if the operator is tiled over K to make sure the output can be read by the successors.
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1679210614791_0.png)
- For a node, possible split over `h` should be:
	- `(2xfeature_in + feature_out)/(cmx-param)`
		- `| wgt | tile0 in | tiled 1 in | tiled0 out |`
	- The output would spill to DDR. No Stride DMA required since tile over the highest dimension.
	- Multi-cluster strategy:
		- split over height (no need for `iti broadcast`)
		- split over kernel (need `iti broadcast`)
- For a node, possible split over `k` should be:
	- `(2xparam)/(cmx-feature_in-feature_out)`
		- `| wgt | in | out | param0 | param1 |`
	- Multi-cluster strategy:
		- split over kernel (if `iti broadcast`, no spilling)
		- split over kernel (if no `iti broadcast`, need to spill)
		- split over height
- Tile in Multiple dimensions
	- pending...
	- For a node, if no solution found for the upper two cases.
		- `CMX < feature and CMX < wgt`
		- N x H x W x C
			- Tile in the order of N x H x W x C
		- Always spill output
- DSP kernel
	- Multi-cluster or tiling
		- Can only support split on the highest dimension.
		- Insert transpose if the split on highest dimension not supported.
