title: C++: queue vs deque vs stack
---
- Difference between queue and deque:
	 - > Queue: you can insert only in one end and remove from the other.
Deque: you can insert and remove from both ends.
So using a Deque, you can model a Queue as well as a Stack.
Hint:
Deque is short for "**D**ouble **e**nded **que**ue".
- Difference between queue and stack:
	 - > [Stack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_%28abstract_data_type%29) is a LIFO (last in first out) data structure. The associated link to wikipedia contains detailed description and examples.
	 - > [Queue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_%28abstract_data_type%29) is a FIFO (first in first out) data structure. The associated link to wikipedia contains detailed description and examples.
