	 - C++ Header files
		 - The header files included in a cpp file will be copied and pasted during the pre-process period before compilation
		 - '#' is this symbol for pre-processing
			 - '# pragma once' prevent the header file to be included twice;
			 - '# ifdef # define # endif' also does the same thing
		 - <> will search the compiler include path for include files, "" is for include local header files ("" can replace <>)
		 - C standard library header files would have .h extensions while C++ standard library files don't. (iostream) vs (stdlib.h)
	 - pointer
	 - reference
		 - can cooperate with variables to get the variable updated without any memory copy
	 - class
		 - size of class
			 - static variable would not take up the size of the class
			 - function would not take up the space either, the function would be stored in other places and have one extra variable and have name space under the class
		 - key words
			 - private, default in class
			 - public, default in struct
			 - protect, can be accessed by child
			 - friend...
		 - constructors
		 - destructors
		 - virtual functions
			 - pure virtual, functions need to be inherited. This is actually a interface in C++
	 - static
		 - in a class, the static variable would only be created once. The static variable is created until the line is reached, unlike const variables.
		 - in a function, similar
	 - string
		 - ends with '\0' and have several member functions
	 - const char*
		 - if you write a string variable like 'qianxu', this would actually allocate a const char* in the const memory that can not be changed in the memory
	 - arrays
		 - stored in between in C++ memory
