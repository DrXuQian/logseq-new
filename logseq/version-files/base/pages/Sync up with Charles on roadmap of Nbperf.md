- Overall:
	- Charles already talked to Darren
	- Nbperf + VPUEM for VPU6, Nbperf for VPUX compiler algorithm development. Opportunity for VPU6, SW impact from Nbperf
- ![image.png](../assets/image_1693536438832_0.png){:height 745, :width 1143}
- Direct Onnx model support:
	- ![image.png](../assets/image_1693536919013_0.png)
		- Higher level interface onnx, lower level select DML/OV-EP
		- Roofline performance analysis from Nbperf, check missing parts of 2 and 3
		- Metacommand support?
		- Subgraph inference with part of that run on CPU and part of that run on VPU
			- VPU simulation while CPU directly run on CPU
- ELF format support:
	- VPUIP Dialect?
- Add Numerics Bench as backend of Nbperf
	- verify the tiling
	- Select device to run considering numeric impact
- Shave kernel gen
	- Auto-gen
	- Template
	- Sql
