- ### Multi-cluster strategy
- First isolated selection, then subgraph opt, revert some back
- ==Missing, consideration of the residual memory in CMX==
- ### Vertical Fusion and Temporal Tiling
- Currently adding control using edges as barrier
- Need to rethink about this by reading more papers about how to schedule a DAG
- ### Mark operator on DDR
- slice and concat on CMX and DDR logic
- ==Missing, slice and concat to DMA==
- Apply node configuration to graph
- ### Schedule optimization
- Add control edge for DFS order
- ==Missing, consideration of the peak memory in CMX==
- ### Memory allocation
- ==Missing, look ahead more distance when prefetching weights==
- ==Missing, insert spill prior to memory allocation==
- ==Missing, allocation with more hints for vertical fusion or temporal tiling pipeline==
- ==Missing, more reasonable allocation hint==
