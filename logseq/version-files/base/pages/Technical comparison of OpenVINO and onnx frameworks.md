- 1. ONNX runtime to DirectML and generate meta command and then run metacommands on VPUX
	- [Sharing from Rutvi and Murali](https://intel-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/personal/jing_cui_intel_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B7DCE8AF7-9EA1-48CB-9F38-0C68FB69F225%7D&file=DML-NPU-Overview-8-23.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true)
	- DML and VPU responsibilities:
		- DirectML output meta command, but that is already allocated meta commands with correct address and efficient tiling from cost model
		- Compiler + driver by Intel handles lowering of that meta command

	- Comparison of two flows:
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1693790326188_0.png){:height 471, :width 833}
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1693790339955_0.png){:height 462, :width 833}
	- Compilation flow of DirectML:

		- What is a meta command:
			- **Metacommands**​
				- -IHV accelerated replacement for graph operators that make best use of the hardware​
				- -A Meta Command is a Deep Learning or Machine Learning (ML) primitive, such as a convolution operation.​
				- -Defined by a GUID ​
				- -Metacommands have four stages: query, creation, initialization, and execution. Each stage has a respective API in D3D​
- 2. Use ONNX runtime + OV-EP
	- -VPUX Plugin
		- -Most optimized way of using VPU devices.
		- -Validation build around VPU Plugin usage.
	- **-OpenVINO-EP (ONNX Runtime)**
		- -Same results should be achievable as with OpenVINO + ONNX model.
		- -ONNX model will be sent to OpenVINO (no conversions to IR).
		- -All optimizations from OpenVINO and VPUX Compiler can be applied to model.
	- -DirectML
		- -Not possible to apply ngraph transformations from OpenVINO.
		- -How to implement backward/forward compatibility. Now it’s responsibility of VPU plugin.
		- -Scheduling logic responsibility –less room for optimizations in VPU Compiler.
		- -Memory allocation
