- [[Abstract]]
	- This article is primarily meant to present an early case study on using MLIR, a new compiler intermediate representation infrastructure, for high-performance code generation. Aspects of MLIR covered in particular include memrefs, the affine dialect, and polyhedral utilities and pass infrastructure surrounding those. This article is also aimed at showing the role compiler infrastructure could play in generating code that is competitive with highly tuned manually developed libraries, albeit in a more modular, reusable, and automatable way.
