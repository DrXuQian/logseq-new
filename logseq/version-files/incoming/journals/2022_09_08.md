- [[barrier safety]]
	- current algorithm proposed by Darren
		- keep barrier pool of DMA/DSP/DPU ops
		- first assign virtual barriers with physical barriers
		- when out of barriers, find from the top the physical barriers that can be released
		- use the barrier that is previously used for the same op type
	- Problem now:
		- barrier assignment need to be done using DMA
		- That need to be inserted somewhere in the graph and need barrier to make sure that this assignment is executed beforehand
			- Solution:
				- reserve some physical barrier for these DMAs.
