- Need to figure out a proper data structure to manage memory snapshots as well as layer order and pipeline within the order
	- Basically, if layer a is prefetched. the successor should remain the successors. And the control predecessors change.
- Another thing is the tiling block, if we don't want to unroll that, we can just calculate the peak memory of the tiling block. For the instructions, it should be fairly simple as:
	- Dealloc input
	- Alloc peak memory
	- Dealloc peak memory
	- Alloc output
