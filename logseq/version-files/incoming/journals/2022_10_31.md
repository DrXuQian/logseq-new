- question for Darren
	- How is the compiler team buy in the KPI from VPUEM + NBperf, seems like there are still large Gap between the vpux compiler and KPI?
	- What is the value of mapping nbperf output to nnhal and run on actual hardware? Can that be a more achievable KPI for the compiler team?
	- For the VPUX compiler, how are we going to contribute to that? I feel that if we just contribute like a normal VPUx compiler developer, that doesn't add much value there.
		- I would say we can try some feature or new algorithm on VPUX compiler as a pitching and see the performance benefit.
