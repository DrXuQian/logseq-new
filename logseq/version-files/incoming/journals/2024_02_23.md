- What is a LLVM dense map? #card
  collapsed:: true
	- `llvm::DenseMap` is a replacement for `std::unordered_map`.
	- Unlike `std::unordered_map`, `std::map` guarantees that the iteration order of the container matches the order defined by your comparator (by default, `std::less`). In many cases, you don't care about iteration order... but in the few cases where it matters, `DenseMap` isn't an option.
	- Now, to contrast `DenseMap` with `std::unordered_map`: unlike the `std` container, `DenseMap` keeps all its data in one memory allocation, and it does away with buckets in favor of keeping keys and values next to each other in memory. Both these features are a big win for [data locality](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/data-locality.html) and thus speed in nearly all contexts.
	- In addition, `DenseMap` allocates a large number of key/value pairs by default (64, in fact), so at small sizes, insertions are nearly free. The downside of that, of course, is that it’s memory inefficient if you’re creating a lot of very small maps, or if your types themselves are large; if your container will never grow to 64 elements, you're wasting memory. That may or may not actually hurt you depending on your use case.
- What is `std::unordered_map`? #card
  collapsed:: true
	- Works kind of a python set. But keep in mind that this is not ordered.
	- ```c++
	  // C++ program to demonstrate 
	  // functionality of unordered_map 
	  #include <iostream> 
	  #include <unordered_map> 
	  using namespace std; 
	  
	  // Driver code 
	  int main() 
	  { 
	  // Declaring umap to be of 
	  // <string, int> type key 
	  // will be of STRING type 
	  // and mapped VALUE will 
	  // be of int type 
	  unordered_map<string, int> umap; 
	  
	  // inserting values by using [] operator 
	  umap["GeeksforGeeks"] = 10; 
	  umap["Practice"] = 20; 
	  umap["Contribute"] = 30; 
	  
	  // Traversing an unordered map 
	  for (auto x : umap) 
	  	cout << x.first << " " << 
	  			x.second << endl; 
	  }
	  
	  ```
- What is `mlir::getOperation()`? #card
  collapsed:: true
	- In the context of MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation), `getOperation()` is a method that is typically called on an object representing a node in the MLIR graph (like an `Op`, `Block`, or `Region`). This method returns a pointer to the `Operation` that the object represents.
	- For example, if you have an `Op` object representing a specific operation in your MLIR graph, calling `getOperation()` on this object would return a pointer to the underlying `Operation`.
	- Here's a hypothetical usage:
		- ```c++
		  mlir::Op myOp = ...;  // Assume this is initialized
		  mlir::Operation* operation = myOp.getOperation();
		  ```
	- In this example, `getOperation()` is called on `myOp` to get a pointer to the underlying `Operation`.
	- In your provided code snippet, `getOperation()` is called without an object, which suggests that it's called in a context where `this` implicitly refers to an object that has a `getOperation()` method, such as inside a method of an `Op`, `Block`, or `Region` class or subclass.
- What is `walk` in MLIR context? #card
  collapsed:: true
	- Here's a breakdown:
		- `func->walk` is called on a `mlir::FuncOp` object, which represents a function in MLIR.
		- The `walk` method takes a lambda function or functor as an argument. This function is called for each operation in the function.
		- The traversal is depth-first, meaning that it visits an operation's operands before visiting the operation itself.
	- Here's a hypothetical usage:
		- ```
		  func->walk([](mlir::Operation* op) {
		  
		  // This code is executed for each operation in the function.
		  
		  // 'op' is a pointer to the current operation.
		  
		  });
		  ```
	- In this example, `func->walk` is called with a lambda function that takes a `mlir::Operation*` as an argument. The lambda function is called for each operation in the function.
- What does `[&]` stands for in lambda function? #card
  collapsed:: true
	- If the `[]` in a lambda function contains an `&`, it means the lambda function is capturing all variables used in its body by reference. This is known as capture-by-reference.
	  
	  Here's a breakdown:
	- `[]`: This is a lambda function that captures no variables.
	- `[&]`: This is a lambda function that captures all variables used in its body by reference.
	  
	  When you capture a variable by reference, the lambda function can modify the variable and the changes will be reflected in the original variable. Also, if the variable goes out of scope in the enclosing function, accessing it in the lambda function will lead to undefined behavior.
- What is a `llvm::MapVector` and the difference to `std::map` and `std::unordered_map`? #card
  collapsed:: true
	- `llvm::MapVector` and `std::map` and `std::unordered_map` are both associative containers that store key-value pairs, but they have some key differences:
	- **Order of elements**: `llvm::MapVector` maintains the insertion order of the elements. This means you can iterate over the elements in the order they were inserted. On the other hand, `std::map` maintains its elements in a sorted order according to the keys. The order of iteration is determined by the sorting of the keys, not the order of insertion. while `std::unordered_map` doesn't maintain the order of the values.
	- **Lookup performance**: `std::map` provides logarithmic time complexity for key lookups, insertions, and removals. `llvm::MapVector` also provides efficient lookup, but it's typically not as fast as `std::map` for large datasets.
	- **Memory usage**: `llvm::MapVector` uses more memory than `std::map` or `std::unordered_map` because it maintains both a map and a vector internally.
- What does `dyn_cast<>` do? #card
	- The `dyn_cast<>` function is a utility provided by the LLVM library. It's used for safely casting between different types of pointers or references in the LLVM's type hierarchy.
