- [[Midasnet Training]]
	- meeting with Diana:
		- Q:
			- What is the config for running Midas_v21_small?
				- She has no idea
			- Are the 10 datasets all needed for training Midas_v21_small?
				- (ReDWeb, DIML, Movies, MegaDepth, WSVD, TartanAir, HRWSI, ApolloScape, BlendedMVS, IRS)
			- I see NNI used in the code base. Are there any results about that?
			- We are targeting for running the Midas efficiently on VPU HW. Since the training time is going to be super huge. I am wondering if you have designed other network structures with less Gops?
