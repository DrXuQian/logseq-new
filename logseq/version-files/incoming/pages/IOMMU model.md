- Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU)
	- MMU component that connects a DMA-capable I/O bus to system memory. It maps device-visible virtual addresses to physical addresses, making it useful in virtualization.
	- To access memory, the GPU sends a data request to a compliant IOMMU. The request includes a shared virtual address and a *process address space identifier* (PASID). The IOMMU performs the address translation using the ==shared page table==. This is illustrated in the following diagram.
