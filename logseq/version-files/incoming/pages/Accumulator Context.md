- in VPU2.7 "accumulator contexts" are introduced which means that multiples of the output stencil size are computed before moving back in the input channel to accumulate all of the input channels into the output accumulator. The single cycle output of the DPU will be a compute cube size of 4x4x16 in the HxWxK dimension creating a total output volume of 256 which corresponds to 256 accumulators. But there are 64x additional accumulators - 256 x 64, meaning an additional 64 cycle of accumulation can be done in additional accumulators. These additional accumulators, or accumulator contexts can vary in the HW or K dimension and it is referred to as NTK and NTHW. NTK refers to additional accumulators in the K i.e. output channel dimension and NTHW is additional accumulators in the HW i.e. output spatial dimension dimension. The diagram below shows the single cycle compute cube output of 4x4x16 as well as the total accumulator context output volume.
