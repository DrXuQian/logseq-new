title:: NBperf: Spatial tiling strategy and broadcast

- Spatial tiling strategy
	- Broadcast update
	- Task Generation
- How to get the tasks for a operator
	- only the Subtensors are needed
	- instead of task manager
- node_configuration
	- Spatial tiling strategy
	- Temporal tiling strategy
	- Broadcast
	- On_ddr
	- Spilling
		- can concat happen on cmx
		- can slice happen on cmx
- In L2:
	- ApplyBestSplitStrategy
		- isolated spatial tiling according to cost function
		- store the results in node configuration
		- Update broadcast and align with previous operator
	- SpatialTilingSubgraphOpt
		- Subtensors size from node configuration + operator
		- update broadcast for strategy switched ops
	- IsolatedTemporalTiling
		- isolated temporal tiling according to cost function
		- store the results in node configuration
		- Can Concat happen on CMX function
		- Can Slice happen on CMX function
	- DMABoundTemporalTiling
		- easier
	- FeasibleAllocation
		- subtensor memory consumption from node configuration + operator
