- Contexts:
	- Hi, we have been working on nbperf front end compiler for both numerics bench as well as vpu-em. I see the goals of nbperf to be complementary to what is done in the PoC compiler, but certainly there can be a lot of collaboration on algorithms, best practices, etc.So Iâ€™d like to setup an initial sync to see how we can collaborate together.
	- Proposed agenda:
		- Align on goals for nbperf, Fathom/PoC compiler and how it feeds into VPUx, etc.
		- Intro of nbperf by Victor and Xu
		- Agree on next steps
- Meeting notes:
	- Nbperf:
		- Meant to run on VPUEM
		- high level blob for VPUEM, performance modelling
	- From Darren perspective
		- Nbperf + VPUNN or Math or VPUEM
		- Alessandro working on Nbperf?
		- Need to think of a unified interface with Nbperf
- Notes from the meeting:
	- Compiler Summary:
		- Nbperf
		    targeting performance simulation with VPU-EM back end with wide network coverage
			- Does not generate an output that can run on the HW
		- PoC/Fathom
		    targeting optimal performance on HW but not targeting wide network coverage
	- Goals:
		- Be able to share algorithms across compilers so that the algo can be validated on actual HW with PoC compiler and get wide network coverage via nbperf and vpu-em
		- Look to modularize algorithms so that they can be shared across compiler
		- Look at IR definition to see if we can have a similar definition at least so that we can align on the features
	- Next steps:
		- Look to document IR between nbperf and vpu-em to at least get rough interface alignment and feature alignment
		- Alessandro to share learnings of PoC compiler code modularization and investigate how this can be leveraged in nbperf
		- Algorithm details sharing for CMX allocation, splitting strategy, physical barrier assignment.
