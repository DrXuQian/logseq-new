	  > very nice analysis Xu!  I think we need some KPIs for accuracy and for inference time.  I would suggest Aswath Narayana, Sandeep and Ambati, Murali to propose an inference time spec.  And Qian, Xu if you could try and come up with a reasonable accuracy expectation proposal
	- accuracy expectation:

- Observation:
	- Almost 1/3 of cycles (5794/15699) from convolution is off by 20% or higher
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1651659107488_0.png)
	- Some outlier points where mathematical cycles is even larger than the cycles from test in DPU hw.
		- like 39337 in [out.csv](../assets/out_1651670035690_0.csv)
	- The utilization is not aligned with the calculated tiling efficiency

- Parameters:
	- input_channels, output_channels, output_height, output_width
	- kernel
	- nthw-ntk
	- output_write_tiles, input_0_swizzling, input_1_swizzling, output_0_swizzling have low impact on hw_utilization
	- execution order
- Hist analysis
	- Data distribution:
		- 7, 14, 28 weirdly higher in frequency than other input shapes
		- output height and width mainly locate in 0-16
		- channels are multiplier of 16 and the smaller channels are sampled more, 2**n is sampled more

- scatter analysis
	- Data distribution:
		- kernel 1, 3, 5, 7 for convolution
		- input width and height are like subplot 3 shows
		- different channels are more sampled for smaller input height and width less sampled for larger input height and width

- Analysis of Execution order
	- Data analysis
		- CUBIO_16x16 is sampled more than the other two modes
