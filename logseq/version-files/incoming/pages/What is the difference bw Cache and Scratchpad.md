- #[[Scratchpad memory]]
- CPU caches are "automatically" managed in that the hardware, when the requested memory contents are not in the cache, fetches that data from main memory. (If it's not in main memory, i.e. been spilled to disk, the OS gets involved, but that's outside the scope of the question.) In modern architectures, caches are generally a hierarchy, with level 1 caches being very fast to access, but small, and level 2 and higher caches being larger and slower. Most of the time, a programmer hopes that accesses hit in L1 or L2 caches, so the processor spends little or no time waiting on memory.
- Scratchpad memories are "manually" managed: a program explicitly addresses the memory, writing results and retrieving them. They are usually relatively small, on the order of L1 or L2 caches, fast (1-2 cycle access), and often more importantly,Â **deterministic behavior/performance**: if you write a scratchpad, the data are always there and ready to go, unlike a cache, where the contents might have been evicted and need to be retrieved. That's one of the reasons why you find scratchpad memories in embedded systems, particularly those with a defined execution set and real time requirements.
