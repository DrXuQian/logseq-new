- Implicit concat when there is split
	- Concat on CMX
		- input from DPU op
			- we perform ODU concat
			- if broadcast:
				- stride:
					- [HWC, WC, C, 1] for DPU
					- starting address varies case by case
			- if no broadcast:
				- stride:
					- [HWC / 2, WC / 2, C / 2, 1]  for SOK concat
					- [HWC / 2, WC, C, 1] for SOH concat
		- input from DDR
			- need DMA to carry the output to certain address
			- If split over multi-cluster, need to change src stride to cut the SOK or SOH corresponding input from the memory in DDR
				- dst stride same as upper
			- If no split, same as broadcast mentioned earlier
		- input from Shave
			- use DMA to do the copy, stride same as DPU op
	- Concat on DDR
		- CMX input:
			- Need two separate DMA to carry the split output from two DPUs
				- Stride analysis same as CMX
			- Need one DMA to carry the output if output broadcast
		- DDR input:
			- stride DMA
- Memory allocation of Concat Op
	- Concat on CMX:
		- Only need to allocate the output
		- Previous DPU OP need to consider to reserve the space for stride DMA
