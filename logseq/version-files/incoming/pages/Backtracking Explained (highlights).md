	- Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons each partial candidate (“backtracks”) as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution

	- The idea is that we can build a solution step by step using recursion; if during the process we realise that is not going to be a valid solution, then we stop computing that solution and we return back to the step before (backtrack).
