- [[Abstract]]
	- In this paper, we propose a novel method to compress CNNs by reconstructing the network from a small set of spatial convolution kernels. Starting from a pre-trained model, we extract representative 2D kernel centroids using k-means clustering. Each centroid replaces the corresponding kernels of the same cluster, and we use indexed representations instead of saving whole kernels. Kernels in the same cluster share their weights, and we ﬁne-tune the model while keeping the compressed state. Furthermore, we also suggest an eﬃcient way of removing redundant calculations in the compressed convolutional layers. We experimentally show that our technique works well without harming the accuracy of widely-used CNNs. Also, our ResNet-18 even outperforms its uncompressed counterpart at ILSVRC2012 classiﬁcation task with over 10x compression ratio.
