- C/C++ userow-majorformat,where  elements  from  the  same  row  are  adjacent  in  memory.GEMM is originally a Fortran routine, and therefore assumesa column-oriented layout, but many DNN implementations arein C/C++, which may result in confusion about array formatsin memory.

- A major problem with the convolution methods from Sec-tion III is that the patch matrix requiresK2more memory thanthe  original  image,  which  is  a  dramatic  increase  in  the  sizeof  the  input.

- In  other  words,1Ã—1MCMK can be implemented by simply calling GEMMwithout data replication.
