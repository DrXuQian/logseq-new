- In the equation, $$C0=4, C1=3, N=32, N_s=2, N_v=128//8$$(nn_shave_length_in_bytes)
	- where $$N_s = \frac{(N*precision)}{vpubits}$$
	- N is the 32x512x512, the 32 here
	- N_s is N divide N_v
	- Inter sub-vector CEX can be done in four cycles per sub-vector pair (processing will be bandwidth bound as two sub-vector reads and two sub-vector writes are   required for every two computations)
	- Intra sub-vector CEX can be done in 3 cycles (again bandwidth limited. Only one input sub-vector is read and one output-sub-vector is written but one LSU slot required to perform swizzle on each of the two compute cycles).
- Suppose $$N_v$$ is the number of elements in a sub-vector, then there will be $$N_s=\frac{N}{N_v}$$ sub_vectors
- where $$C0$$ is the number of cycles cycles to  process a pair of sub-vectors.
- where $$ C1$$ is the number of cycles required to process a sub-vector (intra sub-vector components are processed one sub-vector at a time)
