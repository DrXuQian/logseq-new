### Compiler optimization for spatial accelerator
	- #### Already have:
		- tiling/unrolling
		- vertical fusion (scheduling)
		- prefetch scheduling
		- graph fusion
		- graph rewrite
		- ...
	- #### Good to have:
		- MLIR knowledge
		- C++ knowledge
		- *Other optimization technology like polyhedral optimization...
- ### Model compression
	- #### Already have:
		- unstructured sparsity
		- low-bit compression
		- mixed precision
	- #### Good to have:
		- learn SOTA method, especially for LLM
- ### LLM inference optimization
	- #### Already have:
		- flash attention
		- minimize memory footprint in ff
	- #### Good to have:
		- compression
		- other inference optimization tech, need to check paper list
- ### AI chip architect
	- #### Already have:
		- knowledge of NPU
	- #### Good to have:
		- Learn more about hardware structure of NPU
		- *Learn more about structure of other companies through HotChips
- ### Plan
	- [[Read VPUX compiler code]]
		- [[VPUX: CMX concat]]
		-
	- [[Project of short cut LLM compilation using MLIR (existing code gen of VPUX)]]
	- [[Read papers of LLM inference optimization and model compression]]
	- [[Learn structure of NPU (spec/sas/has)]]
	- [[Watch hotchips replay]]
	- [[Leetcode 2024]]
