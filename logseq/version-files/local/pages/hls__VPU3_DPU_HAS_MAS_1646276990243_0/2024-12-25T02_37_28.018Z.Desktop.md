- On VPU2, each MPE could generate a single point in the output tensor which allowed the 16x16 array of MPEs to produce 256 output points at a time, arranged as a 4x4x16 output tile (HxWxK). This process is shown in Figure 1 for K=256 where 16 output tiles are generated for a given set of 16 spatial (HW) points

- In generating a single output tile, each bye of activations is convolved with 16 different weight sets giving a usage of 16 operations/byte. There is no reuse within the MAC array or MRMs so that activations and weights need to be fully read again when moving on to the next output tile. This is shown in Figure 1 for K=256 where 16 output tiles are generated for a given set of 16 spatial (HW) points.

- On VPU2P6, each MPE can now generate 64 points in the output tensor which allows the 16x16 array of MPEs to produce 16,384 output points at a time, arranged as a 64 4x4x16 output tiles. This process is shown in Figure 2 where 64 output tiles are generated across 128 spatial points and 128 output channels. There are 3 different reuse options available and these options allow a combination of either 4x, 8x or 16x reuse on activations and weights. This increases the operations/bytes up to between 64 and 256 operations/bytes in contrast with the 16 operations/bytes on VPU2. Increasing the operations/bytes reduces the number of read accesses required on CMX.

- Figure 5 shows the flattened view of convolution where HWxC activations are convolved with KxC weights to generate HWxK output points. In this view, a row of activations is elementwise multiplied along C with a row of weights and then the products are summed together before applying an activation function to produce a single output point.

- In VPU2P6, each row of activations and weights is broken into blocks that are “ntc” steps in C long where ntc = 16. The MRMs will store “ntc” bytes at a time for a given spatial point or weight set – this is referred to as a context. E

- In the above diagram, assuming a single simple MAC with the ability to process 16 accumulator contexts (nt = 16). It will first convolve the first “ntc” bytes of ACT0 with WT0, then store off the partial accumulation and proceed to convolve ACT0 with WT1. The partial accumulation is again stored off the process repeats until ACT0 has been convolved with weights WT2 and WT3. At this point, the activation context switches to ACT1 and the process is repeated with weights WT0, WT1, WT2 and WT3. When all activations and weights have been convolved together, generating 16 partial accumulations, the contexts are advanced to use the next “ntc” bytes. At this point, the partial accumulation for ACT0.WT0 is fetched from storage and used as the MAC convolves the portion of ACT0 and WT0. This process is repeated until the end of the Z dimension is reached and there are no more steps to process in C. At this point there are now 16 output points available and each byte of activation and weight data has been reused 4 times by the MAC.
