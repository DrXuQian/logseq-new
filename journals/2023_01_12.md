	- Currently from the profiling, it seems some of the un-efficient networks are due to extra operators like transpose, channel expand. And for some cases, the compiler added extra operators and through manual analysis, we find that the operators can be eliminated or fused. But it requires the compiler to be super smart to be able to chose the best mapping for every case. And an undesired mapping might result in ultra low fps. How are we going to address this issue?
	- The NCE can do many things, operator mapping is very complicated. The combination would be a optimization problem with many options. It is very hard for the compiler to make those decisions.
