		- shocking news
			- if Victor stays, 90% I stay.
			- Darren
				- pros
					- The upper bound is higher
					- 7-9 grade in Darren's team, might grow quicker
					- Projects that interest me
						- Continue what I am doing with NAS and so on
						- Optimize compiler
						- Potentially projects from Intel Lab
				- cons
					- Stuck with VPU for next few years
			- Flex
				- pros
					- Can go with other projects like MLIR on GPU
					- With Victor leaving, I might go one grade higher quicker
				- cons
					- If continue this project, there is no benefit

				- What is [[parser]]? #ques1 #card

			- ```c++
			  class Lexer {
			  public:
			    /// Create a lexer for the given filename. The filename is kept only for
			    /// debugging purposes (attaching a location to a Token).
			    Lexer(std::string filename)
			  : lastLocation(
			        {std::make_shared<std::string>(std::move(filename)), 0, 0}) {}
			    virtual ~Lexer() = default;
			  ```
			- Recall questions:
				- What is [[C++: std::make_shared]]? #ques1 #card
				- What is [[C++: std::move]]? #ques1 #card
				- What is [[C++: std:unique_ptr]]? #ques1 #card
				- Why can't we copy unique pointers? #ques1 #card
				  card-last-interval:: -1
				  card-repeats:: 1
				  card-ease-factor:: 2.5
				  card-next-schedule:: 2022-03-04T16:00:00.000Z
				  card-last-reviewed:: 2022-03-04T11:31:54.980Z
				  card-last-score:: 1
					- Because we will have two pointers pointing to the same memory. If one pointer went out of lifetime, it automatically dies and destroys the memory it points to.
					- Then the other pointer would be dangling. (空指针)
				- [[C++: 函数后面接冒号]]是什么意思？#ques1 #card
					- ```c++
					  Location lastLocation;   /// Location for `curTok`.
					  ```
					- lastlocation 是函数中的一个变量。C++函数后面接冒号
