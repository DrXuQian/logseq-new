- Insights:
	- Nbperf:
		- VPU6 TR, Optimization for LLM
		- LNL: Â New SplitStrategy, SOW, SOHW, SOHK, how compiler use those new features.
		- Model convert: init support for bounded dynamic shape
		- More alignment with VPUX on quantization/layer mapping.
		- Nbperf: switch to l4, and reduce duplicate code.
		- VPU6: Memory Side Cache
	- Results:
	  id:: 64c20dee-147b-4375-9555-451bfe5f5675
		- Feedback and Appreciation
			- Support VPU6TR related topics, developed Memory side cache support in Nbperf, experiment with ODU support for scatter to help with CMX fragmentation.
			- Transformer optimization including more vertical fusion patterns, efficient partition of attention layer that reduces DMA cost, stationary weight/activation...
			- Add new multi-cluster split strategy for LNL and improve strategy selection algorithm in Nbperf.
		- Coaching and Objective Alignment
			- Work on advanced compiler algorithm on scheduling and strategy selection
	- Behavior:
		- Feedback and Appreciation
			- Cooperating with VPUEM on enabling memory side cache
			- Work with compiler team on vertical fusion and shave/dpu/dma pipelining.
		- Coaching and Objective Alignment
			- More exposure and bigger impact
			- More engagement with the compiler team on algorithm development
