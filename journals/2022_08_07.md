	- SOH->SOK
		- broadcast
	- SOK->SOK
		- broadcast
	- SOH->SOH
		- same cluster size, no need to broadcast
	- SOK->SOH
		- broadcast
	- Build distributed buffer
		- For convolution:
			- NS->SOK/SOH
				- output should broadcast
			- SOH/SOK ->NS
				- output should broadcast
			- SOK->SOH or SOK->SOK
				- Output of SOK should broadcast
			- SOH->SOK
				- output of SOH should broadcast
			- SOH->SOH
				- output of SOH should be the same, no broadcast
			- on_ddr->SOH or on_ddr->SOK
				- should be unicast to different clusters
		- For elementwise operators
			- SOK->SOK
				- should be the same
		- SOH/SOK->slice/concat
			- broadcast first
		- slice/concat -> SOH/SOK
			- broadcast first
