- Extract pivot and linear graph
	- Find pivot nodes, that is nodes with multiple child/parents
	- Remove pivot nodes and reconstruct the subgraphs according to the rest nodes
	- Add pivot nodes to the subgraphs related
- Cost function:
	- [[HKSwitch for shave kernel]]
- params:
	- Spatial splits:
		- SOH, SOK, Clustering, (SOW)
	- Temporal splits:
	- Stream output
	- Stream input
- latency estimation:
	- compute of node a + compute of node b
	- DMA latency
- special cases:
	- SOK for shave, need to spill output, stream output
- how to determine in tiling conditions whether or not the DMA can prefetch
