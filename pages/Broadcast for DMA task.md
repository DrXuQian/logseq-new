- DMA
	- Activation
		- CMX2DDR
			- Suppose source tensors is the same shape as dma output tensor size
				- Build 2 DMA to carry the tensor in the first CMX to DDR
			- Suppose source tensors is not the same shape as dma output tensor size
				- Build len(source tensors) DMA to carry the tensors in all CMXs to DDR
		- DDR2CMX
			- Suppose dst tensors is more than 1
				- Build multi tensors to carry to all CMXs, in this way, the tensors need to be aligned with the next operator
			- Suppose dst tensor is 1
- First principle
	- The output subtensors of previous operator need to be aligned with the input subtensors of the next operator
	- The DMA for weight or activation need to be aligned with the corresponding subtensors in the task of the operator that used these weight or activation.
- Ideally, we can use adaptor to wrap the task generation.
