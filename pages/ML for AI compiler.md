- Topoformer by Qualcomm:
	- Topoformer which uses different topological transforms of a DAG for message passing. The node embeddings produced by the encoder are converted into node priorities which are used by the decoder to generate a probability distribution over topological orders.
	- Target for minimizing peak memory consumption.
	- Questions:
		- Is the parallel execution of tensor/vector considered in this paper?
		- Benefit might not that significant?

	- This policy will then be able to generate good sequences for new unseen input graphs.
