- # NCE subsystem
	- ## Feature set
		- Up to 6 Neural Compute Engine Tiles, where each tile consist of:
			- Maximum of 4MB CMX Memory
			- Up to two 512-bit ==ACT-SHAVEs==
			- DPU (2k MACs)
		- DMA Engine:
			- Up to two:
				- 64B [[AXI Interface]] to DDR
				- 64B Read/128B Write Interfaces to CMX
			- Bit Compactor Compression unit for weights decompression
			- ==Broadcasting/Multicasting Capability to allow DMA to feed multiple NCE Tiles simultaneously==
			- Prefetching capability in the DMA controller. **A dedicated prefetch machine provides single read accesses to pages at a configurable offset from the current transfer**. All prefetch commands are carried on the read channel of the converged 64B AXI DMA data bus.
			- Address Patching capability for DRAM Accesses
		- M2I Engine:
			- Support of Cropping, Scaling, Color, Normalization Transforms
			- 16B Write Only and 16B Read Only Interface to CMX
			- No Direct Accesses to DRAM
		- Inter-Tile-Interconnect (ITI) for **output activation sharing** (write-only). ITI provides broadcasting, multicasting and unicasting capability,
		- ==256kB of SHAVE L2 Cache== for Data and Instruction shared between ACT-SHAVEs:
			- Single L2 Cache Instance shared between 6 NCE Tiles with up to two ACT-SHAVE per NCE Tile
		- Barriers for hardware and assisted task synchronization and pipelining
		- Programmable HW FIFO Block for Work Descriptors and IPC
		- Single Tile Yield Recovery due to process defect
		- Virtual Addressing for all resources used during Inference (Memory, Barriers, FIFOs and DMA/M2I Interrupt IDs)

		- ### NCE CMX Barriers
			- The NCE provides up to 128 barriers for hardware assisted task synchronization (each barrier contains 8bit consumer and 8bit producer counter). Number of barriers avaliable for a job depends on number of tiles allocated to it: 16*(Number of Tiles allocated for job). Each barrier consist of:
				- A producer count.
				- A consumer count.
				- A producer count zero hit status.
				- A consumer count zero hit status.
