- View-like operators
	- Reshape
	- Permutecast
- Multi-cluster strategy for view-like operators
	- should align with the previous operators
	- Reshape:
		- Iti broadcast or DMA broadcast or spill
- [[Multi-cluster strategy for CopyOp]]

	- Should always align with the previous operator
	- If not aligned with the next operator, spill
	- Task generation for CopyOp
		- CopyOp: uniformly split across clusters, output also uniformly split across clusters
- [[Multi-cluster strategy for ShaveOp]]
	- If the output need broadcast, always spill the output
