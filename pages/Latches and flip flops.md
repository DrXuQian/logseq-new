- flip flop: used in sequential circuit
- latch: used to store 1 and 0
- | SNO | Flip-flop | Latch |
  | 1 | It is a edge triggered device. | It is a level triggered device. |
  | 2 | It forms the building blocks of many sequential circuits like counters. | These can be used for the designing of sequential circuits but are not generally preferred. |
