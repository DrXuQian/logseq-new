- Plan1:
	- 1. Assign address for activation first, head, toe, head, toe style...
	- 2. Try prefetch weight
	- 3. Spill if can't fit in weight with the current activation set as the weight consumer
	- * Advanced plan1:
		- prefetch weight and activation DMA and shave ops
- Plan2:
	- Determine the two operators that are running in parallel
	- Try prefetch that operator in memory scheduler
		- If fail, revert to not prefetch or reduce prefetch level
		- If success, continue
- More general solution:
	- define different control edges:
		- engine control
			- control edge bw same engines
		- dfs control
			- insert weight copy before memory allocation by inserting dfs control edge
			- dfs control bw operators
				- prev op --> weight copy --> convolution
		- pipeline control
			- inside tiling operations
	- memory allocation:
		- allocate memory according to dfs order
		- remove dfs edges and try prefetching shave output or dma output allocation to previous dpu operators
		- add control edge according to prefetching status
