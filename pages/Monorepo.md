- At first glance, it sounds counterintuitive to host more than one unit of software in a single repository, but there are few advantages on having all components stored in the same place:
	- All dependencies are easily within reach, just in a different path
	- Multiple-project changes in a single changeset
	- No more versioning issues between internal modules, all of them are always in sync
	- Easier to share knowledge between teams, their code is just there for you to change
- Why then, would you ask, have we typically used single repositories until recently? Well, there are a few reasons also:
	- Code isolation
	- Smaller repository size
	- Access control to the code
	- Higher chance of merge conflicts
	- Easier to deploy
