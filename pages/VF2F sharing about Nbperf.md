	- Hi, every one, this is Xu. My topic today is introduction to nbperf
	- And this is today's agenda, first I will give you the overview of Nbperf. Then I am going to introduce more details about Nbperf. The features we are supporting in Nbperf and model coverage status in this week. Finally, we are going to discuss about the roadmap of Nbperf. Features to add and software evolving path. Also, if you have some suggestion or ideas for us. That will be great.
	- First, as this graph shows, Nbperf serves as the front end compiler for VPUEM. VPUEM and Nbperf combined is aimed to generate scalable and accurate performance projection on VPU. VPUEM is developed by Charles's team.  And in case you are not familiar with VPUEM. VPUEM is this performance modeling tool which can model VPU behavior and resource competition among hardware modules. As you can see in this chart. VPUEM framework include simulation of shave, DPU and DMA engine. So supposedly, the profiled results should be closer to hardware results.
	- And Nbperf take in the xml graph from Openvino, and compiled the high level IR. And output the desired format for VPUEM.
	- Nbperf mainly serves the two objectives listed here. First is as the last slide shows. Nbperf is the front end compiler of VPUEM. In this task, we mainly focus on the model scalability. And we have enabled many networks for this purpose. Another important objective of Nbperf is as the open platform for compiler algorithm prototyping. Since we did not care about the accuracy of the model. Just performance in Nbperf. Also, we did not consider a lot of the low level constraint as VPUX compiler. So it is much easier to do quick prototyping and implement new algorithm in Nbperf. And once you implement a new algorithm, we can use VPUEM to check the performance impact on a wide range of networks.
