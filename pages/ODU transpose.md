- ODU reads data in ZXY format, Z is the continuous dim in memory.
- Possible layout for ODU output
	- ZXY
	- ZYX
	- YZX
	- YXZ
	- XZY
	- XYZ
- ODU transpose when there is need for split
	- SOK and transpose
		- NCHW->NHWC
		- split over channel dims
	- [1, 16, 224, 224]
		- dpu0:
			- [1, 8, 224, 224] -> [1, 224, 224, 8]
		- dpu1:
			- [1, 8, 224, 224] -> [1, 224, 224, 8]
		- stride:
			- [dtype: 1, N: 16 * 224 * 224, H: 16 * 224, W: 16, C: 1]
